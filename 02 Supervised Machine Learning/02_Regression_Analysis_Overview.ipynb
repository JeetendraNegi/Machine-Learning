    "\n",
    "**Regression Analysis** is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between a **dependent variable** (target) and one or more **independent variables** (predictors or features). It helps in understanding how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the others are held fixed.\n",
