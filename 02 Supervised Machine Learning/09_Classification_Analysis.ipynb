    "\n",
    "1. ### **Binary Classification**\n",
    "   - Only **two** possible classes.\n",
    "   - âœ… Example: Spam or Not Spam, Yes or No\n",
    "   - âœ… Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ### **Multiclass Classification**\n",
    "   - More than **two classes**, but **only one** label is assigned per input.\n",
    "   - âœ… Example: Classifying animals into Cat, Dog, or Horse.\n",
    "   - âœ… Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ### **Multilabel Classification**\n",
    "   - Each input can have **more than one label**.\n",
    "   - âœ… Example: A movie can be Action **and** Comedy.\n",
    "   - âœ… Algorithms: Modified versions of Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ### **Imbalanced Classification**\n",
    "   - One class has **much fewer examples** than others.\n",
    "   - âœ… Example: Fraud detection â€” very few fraud cases vs many non-fraud cases.\n",
    "   - âœ… Requires special techniques like SMOTE, weighted loss."
