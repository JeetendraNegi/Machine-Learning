    "## üìò Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Silhouette Score** is a metric used to **measure how well each point fits within its cluster** compared to other clusters.  \n",
    "It shows **how similar** a point is to its **own cluster** (cohesion) compared to **other clusters** (separation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The score ranges from **-1 to 1**:\n",
    "  - **+1** ‚Üí Point is well matched to its own cluster and far from others (good clustering).\n",
    "  - **0** ‚Üí Point is on or very close to the decision boundary between two clusters.\n",
    "  - **-1** ‚Üí Point might be in the wrong cluster.\n",

    "## üßÆ Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single data point **i**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let **a(i)** = average distance between **i** and all other points in the **same cluster** (intra-cluster distance).\n",
    "- Let **b(i)** = average distance between **i** and all points in the **nearest different cluster** (nearest-cluster distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Silhouette Score s(i)** is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[\n",
    "s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max(a(i), b(i))}\n",

    "### Step 1: Cluster the Data\n",
    "- Apply any clustering algorithm (like K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.) to divide the data into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Pick a Data Point\n",
    "- For each point, calculate:\n",
    "  - **a(i)**: The average distance from the point to all other points in the **same cluster**.\n",
    "  - **b(i)**: The lowest average distance from the point to points in any **other cluster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Compute the Silhouette Score\n",
    "- Use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[\n",
    "s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max(a(i), b(i))}\n",
    "$]\n",
    "\n",
    "- This gives a score between -1 and 1 for that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Repeat for All Points\n",
    "- Calculate the silhouette score for **each data point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Average the Scores\n",
    "- Take the **mean of all scores** to get the **overall Silhouette Score** for the clustering solution.\n",

    "## üìå Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- To **evaluate the quality** of clustering.\n",
