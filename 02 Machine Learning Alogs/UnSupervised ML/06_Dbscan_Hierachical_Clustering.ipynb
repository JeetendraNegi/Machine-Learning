    "# üåê DBSCAN Clustering (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìò What is DBSCAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DBSCAN** is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are **close and densely packed**, and labels others as **noise**. It does **not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance**, unlike K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Eps (Œµ ‚Äì Epsilon):**\n",
    "- The maximum **distance** between two points for them to be considered as **neighbors**.\n",
    "- It defines the **radius** of a neighborhood around a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **MinPts (Minimum Points):**\n",
    "- The **minimum number of points** required to form a dense region.\n",
    "- Includes the point itself and its neighbors (within Eps).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Core Point:**\n",
    "- A point is a **core point** if at least `MinPts` points (including itself) are within its Eps neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Border Point:**\n",
    "- A point that is **not a core point**, but is **within the neighborhood** (Eps) of a core point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Noise (Outlier):**\n",
    "- A point that is **neither a core point nor a border point**.\n",
    "- It does not belong to any cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ Step-by-Step Working of DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Choose Parameters\n",
    "- Select values for **Eps** and **MinPts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Visit Each Point\n",
    "- For each point in the dataset:\n",
    "  - Find all **neighboring points** within distance Eps.\n",
    "  - Count the number of neighbors (including the point itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Determine Point Type\n",
    "- If the number of neighbors ‚â• MinPts ‚Üí **Core Point**\n",
    "- If < MinPts but the point is in the Eps neighborhood of a core point ‚Üí **Border Point**\n",
    "- If not ‚Üí **Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Form Clusters\n",
    "- Start from any **unvisited core point**.\n",
    "- Create a new cluster.\n",
    "- Add all its Eps-neighbors to the cluster.\n",
    "- Recursively add all **density-reachable** core and border points.\n",
    "- Repeat for all other core points not yet assigned to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Label Remaining Points\n",
    "- All points that are **not assigned** to any cluster and are **not reachable** ‚Üí labeled as **noise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Example Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine plotting data points on a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You drop a **circle of radius Eps** around a point.\n",
    "- Count how many data points fall inside this circle.\n",
    "  - If it's ‚â• MinPts ‚Üí it's a **core**.\n",
    "  - If it's less, but inside someone else‚Äôs core ‚Üí **border**.\n",
    "  - Else ‚Üí **noise**.\n",

    "## ‚úÖ Advantages of DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does **not require** the number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "- Can find **arbitrarily shaped** clusters.\n",
    "- Handles **noise/outliers** well.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ùå Limitations of DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance can degrade in **high-dimensional data**.\n",
    "- Sensitive to the choice of **Eps and MinPts**.\n",
    "- Not suitable for datasets with **varying densities**.\n",
