    "## üìò Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Machine Learning** refers to a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data **without labeled outputs**. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike supervised learning, there is **no target variable**. The algorithm learns from the structure of the data itself.\n",
