    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "- **Type:** Linear model\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Binary or multi-class classification (e.g., Spam vs Not Spam)\n",
    "- **Assumption:** Features are **linearly** related to the log-odds of the outcome\n",
    "- **Output:** Probabilities (can be thresholded into class labels)\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** High (coefficients show how features affect the outcome)\n",
    "- **Performance:** Best on **simple, linearly separable** data\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Less prone, but may **underfit** complex data\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Very efficient on large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Pros\n",
    "- Simple and fast\n",
    "- Provides class probabilities\n",
    "- Interpretable coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Cons\n",
    "- Cannot model complex or non-linear patterns\n",
    "- Assumes independence and linearity\n",

    "## Decision Tree Classification\n",
    "- **Type:** Non-linear model\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Classification (binary or multi-class)\n",
    "- **Assumption:** No assumptions about feature relationships\n",
    "- **Output:** Class label (based on majority in leaf node)\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** Moderate (can be visualized as a tree)\n",
    "- **Performance:** Great on **non-linear or rule-based** data\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Can easily overfit without pruning\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Slower on very large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Pros\n",
    "- Handles non-linear relationships and interactions\n",
    "- No need for feature scaling or linear assumptions\n",
    "- Easy to visualize and explain\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Cons\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting\n",
    "- Small changes in data can change the tree structure\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use **Logistic Regression** when data is linearly separable and you want probabilities.\n",
    "- Use **Decision Trees** when data is complex, rule-based, or non-linear.\n"
