    "# ⚖️ Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification** and **regression**.  \n",
    "It tries to find the **best boundary (hyperplane)** that separates classes with the **maximum margin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 How SVM Works (Simple Steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each data point is plotted in n-dimensional space**, where n = number of features.\n",
    "2. SVM tries to draw a **straight line (or a plane in higher dimensions)** that separates the classes **as far apart as possible**.\n",
    "3. The line or plane that does this is called the **hyperplane**.\n",
    "4. The points **closest to the hyperplane from each class** are called **Support Vectors**.\n",
    "5. The **margin** is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors).  \n",
    "   SVM tries to **maximize this margin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 How SVM Chooses 2 Points (Support Vectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM selects **2 (or more)** points — **one from each class** — that are **closest to the hyperplane**.\n",
    "- These points are **most critical** in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane.\n",
    "- These are the **\"support vectors\"** — if they were removed, the hyperplane would change.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Linear vs Non-Linear\n",
    "\n",
    "- If data is **linearly separable**, SVM finds a straight line (or plane).\n",
    "- If not, SVM uses a technique called the **kernel trick** to map data into a higher dimension where it **becomes separable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Advantages\n",
    "- Works well for both **linear and non-linear** problems.\n",
    "- Very effective in **high-dimensional** spaces.\n",
    "- Robust against **overfitting**, especially in text or image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ Disadvantages\n",
    "- Not ideal for very **large datasets** (training is slow).\n",
    "- Doesn’t perform well when classes overlap heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> SVM finds the best boundary that separates classes by the **widest possible margin**, and only the closest points (**support vectors**) matter in this decision.\n"
